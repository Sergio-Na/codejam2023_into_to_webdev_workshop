# Workshop Setup Guide

Welcome to the Intro to Web Development workshop! Before you attend the workshop, please follow these steps to set up your development environment.

## 1. Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a popular and free code editor that will help you write and manage your web development code.

To install Visual Studio Code, visit the [VSCode download page](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

## 2. Python

Python is a versatile programming language commonly used in web development. You can download and install Python by following the official documentation:

- [Python Official Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Choose the latest stable version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux), and follow the installation instructions provided in the official Python documentation.

## 3. Virtual Environment

A virtual environment is a way to create an isolated environment for your Python projects. It allows you to manage dependencies and packages separately for each project. To set up a virtual environment, follow these steps:

- [Python Virtual Environments](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)

Visit the Python documentation on virtual environments for an explanation of what they are and how to create and activate a virtual environment.

Once you've created your virtual environment, you can install Python packages specific to your project within that environment, keeping your project dependencies separate from the system-wide Python installation.

## 4. Flask

[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) is a lightweight web framework for Python that we'll be using in the workshop. You can install Flask using Python's package manager, pip, within your virtual environment. Here's how:

- [Flask Installation Guide](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/installation/)

Follow the Flask installation guide linked above for detailed instructions on how to install Flask using pip within your virtual environment.

That's it! You're now ready to get started with web development using VSCode, Python, Flask, and a virtual environment. We look forward to seeing you at the workshop!
